# CATCH.PY
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/-blMNPSoEiY
#### Description:
CATCH.PY is a retro fruit-catcher game implementing pygame where the player controls a basket (left or right) to catch falling apples while avoiding bombs. The objective is to score as many points as possible by catching apples, with powerups like golden apples restoring lives and magnets pulling apples towards the basket. Bomb speed increases each time the player scores 20 points. After player scores 30, diagonal bombs may be spawned. Special advice: try to stay in the middle of the screen so you can fastly move to the left or right end.
### Rules:
    Move the basket left and right using arrow keys.
    Press spacebar to pause and resume game.
    Catch red apples to increase the score.
    Golden apples restore all lost hearts (lives).
    Bombs & diagonal bombs result in an instant game over if caught.
    Magnets attract apples towards the basket for 6 seconds.
    If an apple falls to the ground, a life is lost.
    The game ends when all hearts are lost.
